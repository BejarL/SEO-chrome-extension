## Overview

SEO Assistant is a Chrome extension designed to help web developers and content creators optimize their web pages for search engines directly from their browser. It provides real-time SEO analysis and actionable recommendations to improve webpage visibility and performance in search results.

## Features

## Installation

2. Click "Add to Chrome" to install.
3. Once installed, you'll see the SEO Assistant icon in your browser toolbar.

## Usage

## How It Works

- **Content Analysis**: The extension fetches and analyzes the content of the current webpage. This includes HTML elements, text content, and metadata.
- **SEO Scoring**: A proprietary algorithm evaluates the SEO-friendliness of the page based on various factors like keyword density, tag usage, and mobile compatibility.
- **Editor Integration**: TinyMCE is used to provide a robust text editing environment within the browser, allowing users to experiment with changes without affecting the live website.

## Unit Tests

- Test individual functions in `contentAnalysis.js` and `feedback.js` for correct behavior.
- Mock API responses to ensure the extension can handle different data formats and errors gracefully.

## Integration Tests

- Verify that `contentAnalysis.js` and `feedback.js` work seamlessly together, providing accurate feedback based on analyzed content.
- Test the interaction between the background script and content scripts to ensure settings are applied correctly.

## User Acceptance Tests

- Conduct tests with real users to assess the usability and effectiveness of the content analysis features.
- Gather feedback on the UI and make adjustments based on user preferences and difficulties encountered.

## Automated Testing
